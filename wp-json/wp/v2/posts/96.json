In that way, physical movements are translated into virtual movements &#8220;, explained Rodrigo Savage.<\/p>\n<p>To complete this feeling, the app is accompanied by virtual reality headsets designed for this project, which create immersive spaces for those who train feel that they are rowing in a boat on water or skiing in the snow.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With the lenses you are transported to another place. If you are doing rowing exercises in the gym, you see yourself at sea. They can also connect you online to compete with others. We want to motivate people to do physical activity, encourage them and have a goal to achieve, &#8220;he said.<\/p>\n<p>The device has different workouts, so the user can select routines or a coach that guides and configures the equipment. You can also train in a group, with people of the same level or more advanced, which motivates you to try harder.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The virtual lenses are special to be used for more than half an hour, light and do not fog because their design allows ventilate them. &#8220;I took care of the design of the VR headset, which is light and does not skid or fog due to its lateral ventilation; You can also clean the sweat, &#8220;said Samantha Morales, industrial designer.<\/p>\n<p>For his part, Josu\u00e9 Urbina, also of Engineering, works in the part of artificial intelligence, evaluating a catalog of motivational music to improve the performance of the athlete.<\/p>\n<p>The young people have created the company Intero to take their app to the market, and in the UNAM they collaborate with Norma Elva Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez, teacher of the FI, in her class of research projects, to teach the students to do research and write Scientific articles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gaceta.unam.mx\/index\/crean-egresados-un-entrenador-deportivo-virtual-y-personalizado\/\">http:\/\/www.gaceta.unam.mx\/index\/crean-egresados-un-entrenador-deportivo-virtual-y-personalizado\/<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1496,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2,3,1],"tags":[7,13],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/96"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=96"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/96\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2303,"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/96\/revisions\/2303"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1496"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=96"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=96"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/interovr.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=96"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
